<div id="note">
<p><em>DB password:</em></p>
<p><em>It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, <br>
    Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. <br>
    It lies behind stars and under hills, <br>
    And empty holes it fills. <br>
    It comes out first and follows after, <br>
    Ends life, kills laughter.</em></p>

<p><span>... did nobody tell them that you should not keep your passwords lying around?...</span></p>
